"College Road"}, "split_transcript": "through the whole United States [Music] welcome to geoghasm today we're going to play Geo detective I personally like to take some time and look around and gather the clues and think about it and then guess something rather than very fast paced games so this might be just something for me and possibly for you you can play along by clicking on this link down in the description the way I recommend this to be played is that you play one round when you have clicked on the location do not click guess yet but go back to my video and watch that particular round to the end and only then just click on the guest that keeps the maximum tension because then you don't know what the location is when you're watching my video then go back to your game and do the same for the next round but if that sounds complicated or annoying to you you can also just play through the whole thing and then watch my video or you can just watch my video if that's the only thing you want you do you right this map is ended for non-moving games difficulty is mixed so some locations are meant to be hard we are going to have no time limit moving is not allowed and off we go [Music] okay so this the sun is right there in the East so that's not very helpful yield drive on the right College Road US1 so we are in the United States United States yes indeed we are in the United States for some reason there is a person riding a bike in the United States hmm that's very surprising this looks very Southern with the palm trees and everything there are no front plates in some of the cars that tells something to someone for sure us one that is probably something that we could find there must be a road number one somewhere it could very well be in California I think the numbering starts from here if I'm not mistaken there's 101 that's a famous road but where is us one but we got one here um but that's a local Road I can't quite see what these things are unfortunately but if this is the one we're talking about where is there a college I'm thinking this would make more sense right US1 would be San Francisco perhaps the 101 is going West and East and College Road is to the north this doesn't seem right a well-named Corona Road here wonder if they would want to change the name get education tribe that's pretty close to a college Road isn't it there is a college library here but no College Road it seems so close though so close Okay so I couldn't find it south of San Francisco so I guess I'll go back to San Francisco and look up north from there getting kind of tired with this one I could not find it so I wonder what should I do at this point okay so a new tactic I didn't find anything and I spent way too much time on that then I thought maybe this is not the right number one maybe there are more number ones and then I thought I'll go to Washington because I thought maybe row number one starts from Washington I don't know well I did find row number one and it's uh Highway one U.S Highway one so I was like all right Yes actually it's this one in the east coast so I decided to follow it all the way through New York and Boston and so on and I I spent quite a lot of time quite a lot of time but because I'm I'm completely sure this is the road and I will just find it I will find it I went down all the way to the southernmost point of Road one I just checked where it is and Key West the number one Highway goes all the way here to the southernmost point of the Continental USA and then I decided that let's start from this end and see if we can actually get to something like a college Road oh so I'm not very much looking forward to this but but anyway here is mile marker zero that's what I found zero mile art this is a thing apparently in the United States [Applause] foreign [Music] holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] College Road going north and then turning to the left oh it doesn't it looks like it turns more to the left but makes sense there's some building there there is a bridge here that tracks and most importantly there is water on the south side that explains these boats here oh for [\u00a0__\u00a0] sake so all this time it was in the very beginning of row number one I guess that makes sense if you think about how you're supposed to find this place without being as crazy as I am and go through the whole United States the College of the Florida Keys never heard of it so it's not like very important we're actually on the road a little bit so here yes yes oh I'm sure you know it's not better detectives or whatever could have found this quicker but I literally had to ", "points": "5000", "distance": 0.0, "challenge_info": {"challenge": {"token": "6Xv9zhYR8q517DJU", "mapSlug": "5d374dc141d2a43c1cd4527b", "roundCount": 5,

"split_transcript": "meters count foreign this looks really nice I like it what a beautiful picture um this could be a flag of Kazakhstan um so let's head right into Astana and there should be a building like this then if that is the flag of Kazakhstan uh there is a big road going um let's see that has to have some sort of a special name that's probably the parliament or something the road is going south uh and North oh [Music] okay um so I took a while um because as it happens uh um they specifically said that the compass is never wrong but look at this um so this is the flag of Kazakhstan I'm absolutely certain of this that was the beginning of this so this is Kazakhstan and we are in Astana what was my guess uh then I started looking around and I uh I saw that the river is going here to the south on the south side and west side so I looked at this and I was looking for stuff here because the river would be on the south and the west side it's only after I looked at the Sun and I realized that the sun is in the North the sun is in the north that means that we would be in the southern hemisphere deep in the southern hemisphere so I got really confused about this until I realized that this simply cannot be the compass has to be wrong it has to be in fact as backwards again the compass is exactly wrong it is Kazakhstan flag and also there are other tips here as well there is acrylic there is no place in southern hemisphere that has kerylic after I realized that the sun is in the absolute wrong direction I realize that we are exactly on the opposite side of the river so I finally found uh my place here so we have um lovers Park here big Park uh on the side of it there is a round building like this these were the easiest ones to find then you have something here called the circle the road goes through the circle so you see it here we are on that road right here it's going up and right next to us is uh this building here uh called I guess the Triumph of Astana or something like this so we are right here there is a football field here and some buildings here so these lines up perfectly if I look down I can see that we are pretty much on top of or in the in the corner of this road that is coming from uh from this building right here and it lines up with the fourth building on the other side there are four buildings here so it lines up with this one we are in the middle of of this one my guess is is this one it was a bit more difficult maybe than the previous ones but knowing Kazakhstan flag uh this wasn't too hard it's just the fact that that the compass was actually wrong uh after they promised that it isn't so it took me a while but I will edit that out so you don't have to worry about it I'm just telling you I probably looked around for about 10 minutes so thank you for that whoever made this map I would like to have my 10 minutes back if you could send it to me in on a private message or something like this that would be really nice thank you very much let's see what Mr Geo guesser has to say about this oh my goodness we're up on a building this reminds me of the other map I used to play bird's eye bird's eye view this could be harder this look at the colors of these houses insane buildings that one over there I've got an idea but it's nothing more than an absolute punch in McDonald's down there at first I thought they look and they do look quite Norwegian um or Icelandic or even sort of somewhat Slovakian no Eastern European but I don't think it's eastern Europe just look at these and I think look how spread out they are is that something you would find in Eastern Europe looking at this from an architectural point of view very typical of these former Soviet Asian countries is that they build very bombastic uh capitals like golden buildings there and and so on they might not be very representative of the architecture of the country generally I don't know much about Kazakhstan but I doubt that it looks like this all over the place that might be the reason why there's all sorts of fields about the architecture here and there is the giveaway guys there's a bloody flag it's um it's found it well what is the capital these days is it Astana I think it is Astana but they changed the name to uh I did I think they changed the name to something like not so Sultan but oh there it is actually Nur Sultan yeah Nur Sultan is the is the name of the of the capital nowadays I think we've got water over there to the east doesn't and now he's running the same problem as I did the compass is wrong yeah who knows how long he's spending time here also uh looking in all the wrong places it's the idea that your compass is wrong there's the McDonald's there's the McDonald's well so I would say that uh let's try it two yards oh that's so good you're all three okay so let's take a look two yards that's pretty impressive 400 meter I'm even closer wow this is this is tight now we're fighting over

me versus him versus you okay so gear wizard has uh challenged his viewers to a map called done test for smart people it sounds uh terrifying I'm going to take this challenge you can also take this challenge click on the link below you can play it for free even if you don't have a geocacher subscription so you're not losing anything except maybe your time and possibly your sanity I'm going to play one round get the result then jump back to Geo Wizards video before the time runs out so I don't see my result and then I'm going to watch his video and see his result and then compare with my result last time I tried to do this with all this video making equipment and everything I failed most of the time but that's life you know failing most of the time is how I would describe life and what you should be doing if if you want to play along is the same thing but first play the round or the time runs out you should jump to my video watching me play Jump the jail Wizards video it's crazy it's just it's just insane it's a  in uh in a good way possibly could be in a bad way as well um you can also play The Challenge from beginning to the end to make it more easy for you you know like logistically more easy if there is a text here so that we should probably be red of course you know where these are but do you each famous place has the original location plus one look-alike location let's see if you can recognize the original landmark and if you can pinpoint where its look-alike is 30 famous local locations 30 look-alikes that actually sounds like I'm gonna do terribly on this if you remember my fake Taj Mahal video I also did not take very kindly to people making things that look like Taj Mahal so let's head right into it hi hello everyone why am I grinning I don't know it's been a while how not to travel America gracing your screens very soon not before the trailer which will be out in a week or so now though guys it's Geo guesser time it's geoghasm time that's what he wanted to say uh I'm gonna let you guys play along with this one no moving and no time limit as he said no time limit but also no moving okay well that seems fair enough did you make those does she look guilty did she make these statues like okay so if the idea is to know whether these are real or not I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that there is no chance in hell that these are not real or they are quite small though aren't they supposed to be big oh this one is quite big so yeah so my point is that there's quite a lot of them and they look like they have been there a while so I would be very surprised if these were somebody's idea of of a fun Pastime to to build these things and then pass them off as as real ones on top of that this is definitely on the sea which is where these should be so these are the famous uh I wanted to say Talking Heads but I don't think they talk but they are in the uh Easter Islands now this is indeed a good question do I know where Easter Islands are I'm not completely sure I think they are somewhere here but where are they actually called Easter Islands or not or are they called Bora Bora that sounds somehow familiar to me Bora Bora or is it just because it's so like uh very Dancy Place Bora Bora Bora Bora um so yeah I don't know I think I do know where Easter Islands are not there but I do not know exactly where Easter Islands are that's the problem so this might actually take a while there are all sorts of little Islands here which one of these is the Easter are you the Easter Island no it doesn't even look like the Easter Bunny you know this is not so easy as I thought it would be Mommy foreign that sounds very much to me like that uh Easter Island [Music] yeah why aren't they my statues or something like that so I think I found the island finally uh it actually says kapanui and didn't I see something like this here I I totally saw that Rapa Nui yes so I think this is the right place this person has clothed from the right place so now the question is if if we are in the right place we are looking uh straight to the South so this would make sense here this we have um Hills behind us and we have a rock coming out from the south west there is a hill here I'm thinking this seems like the right place let's see the roads there are some roads here uh do this make any sense one road is going there one would maybe go somewhere here it could be this one but then we would have a road going down that would be I don't know does this go somewhere tough to say So based on the the depth map here I'm thinking rather that this would be this rock then there is another one coming out like this which I don't quite see but that could be very close we could for instance be rather here where we would have this Punta Baya not really not seeing that either okay after after looking around for a while uh I don't really know I can't really interpret the landscape so well I think this um this here is uh this one here but I can't understand the distance from this picture I don't know what this one is here um but it could simply be something like this land coming coming up there at some point very difficult to say um there is a mountain or a hill uh behind us that makes a lot of sense um to see like if there's a hill here that let's see would that it will turn and disappear somewhere uh there so we wouldn't see anything uh but it's very difficult to say there is a house here in the distance that I cannot see so Southwest there is nothing on the map that points to any house uh but anyway I think we are on the right Island these are real I hope so because I spent some time looking around and I'm going to uh guess this place but before that I'm gonna see what Mr chill wizard has to say about this those are the heads on Easter Island surely surely they are the originals that looks like some sort of Maori thing Kappa Nui or something sun is in the north so that would support the idea that we're at Easter Island so where is Easter Island that's also nice to see that he also doesn't know where Easter Island is so I thought that was the the Geo guesser here that doesn't know but he also doesn't know it's not something that you look up from the map very often this might take me a little while to find I think it would say Easter Island unless it's one of those things where they've changed its name he did say Easter Island just not in English I think it is this and that they've changed the name of it on the map to hang a rower right we just got to look now at the coastline it's it's going to be interesting because my other guess would be this hunger those were the two guesses I had but I decided to go with the other one which I might end up regretting I think he's gonna go with this one there is the museum there that would correspond possibly with the building there but I think the building wasn't quite on the on the coast and here on the map it shows it's really on the coast so I'm thinking it's it's not that place but I I don't know it's very difficult to assess distances on on this picture wherever we are we're in line with flip so if we drew a line from the cliff Edge is quite cool actually to that so that would put us ah that would put us more like there and that could be it now we've got to be here we've got to be here I'm just going to click that's too far away anyway so I think I think we are there let's have a go  Wit oh I was right or 980 I was wrong okay let's let's just check mine uh my guess here um was uh closer it was a little bit more to the west but yeah that area was the correct area indeed it's that uh vocal length or whatever it's it's very it's caused the picture to be very flattened everything looks to be very close in fact the clips

"split_transcript": "um because if if the if the airport is a normal size airport with something like two kilometer Runway then this is at least like five or six kilometers away from those Hills I don't think you can really assess the distances from that picture yeah and I mean this is his distance here this was uh already three point that's actually even more I mean this is this is five kilometers here so it's 10 kilometers to the to the cliff okay so we're gonna go for the next round I hope you can see me a little bit better now so next round okay so this is how it's going to work I suppose so we got the uh first the real ones and this is a pretty obvious one that this is not the real one the question is where are these this looks like um Chinese script or it could be Japanese they look Japanese text is Japanese um so we are somewhere in Japan where they are showcasing these uh these statues or uh replicas of them at least that's pretty easy to see that they are replicas but where are we we are in the east coast of Japan um nothing else to be seen here this could be an island oh hi I love this age when kids like they know how to walk but the walking is always somehow awkward that's really funny to to watch them do that and clearly this this kid has just learned to walk because that is walking behind to to to catch the kid Okay so we could be in one of the islands here what if one of these islands has like there is a zoo for instance a village of the sea uh there is some kind of a monument here so this looks like a very good option for being an island where they would have put these things I'm thinking we are in some kind of some kind of Island I'm not gonna spend forever here don't worry I'm just gonna check if I happen to actually come across uh this thing uh there is a toilet I saw a toilet so maybe it's this one I'm obviously joking but it could be that one I'm not gonna go through all the islands and all the possible areas in Japan that would be Insanity I'm going to go with the first one that makes some sense and that would be this Oshima Island that has a zoo park why well we have butterflies here that pizza zoo park doesn't it we got some other stuff here not sure what that is but there is something more than just these things this is not just an ordinary park there is a building there up in the hills so this could totally be a zoo park for instance though it doesn't have that sort of a cliff to the east what about this area here yeah I would really want it to be that zoo park but I don't think it is I don't know what that is but I'm gonna go here and because there is like an area like this straight to the like Southeast so it's gonna be like this maybe I'm just gonna go there and see what happens let's see if Geo wizard knows where this is oh my God so this is the so maybe this map is programmed to give you the original and then somehow they give you the alternative the the copy or the other way around so this is the copy you'd have to be pretty dumb to think that this was the original because I agree you've got Asian writing as well haven't you yeah you've got like Japanese writing there oh look at this little toddler toddling over yeah that's that's the most interesting part about this picture that looks Japanese that I'm not sure Greek almost it's really confusing what is that there is something odd about that script I have to uh admit I wonder if we can be on one of these you know ah is that a map of the island it looks a bit squared isn't it it looks a bit like runescaping I thought that was the map of the the park whatever that is but yeah I guess it could be a map of the island that's not too dissimilar no look at that isn't it the upside down it's like it should be the upside down but I still wonder why would they have a map of the whole island there why wouldn't like if you are in a some sort of a zoo or a museum area or something like a park or whatever you generally have a map of that Park and not the whole uh Island unless it's a very small island almost identical to that but flipped flipped around yeah to Japanese people around you can see the boxy bit there apologies if I'm wrong about this I think I am wrong actually it comes too far down here it's pretty close screw it I'm gonna go back to the upside down math screw it will go here how wrong could this be um what look at that we were actually on Japan yeah so I'm just gonna make my guess as well so clearly the idea that this would be an island was simply wrong and that probably made it pretty much impossible to find it because no sane person is going to go through the east coast of Japan trying to find this place unless they're in insane sane person I was a little bit closer probably but a very mediocre result I think it's much more important to be able to find the actual Easter Island and these Maui statues it's uh San Mesa oh there it is different models of Easter Island statues it is possible to find but nobody would zoom in that close and go through the whole of Eastern Seashore of Japan I think it's impossible to get if you do not know around ", "points": "2675", "distance":

call it but is this the real one is this the real deal the real deal let's see let's see what's it called again um is it is it this one that this one is pointing possibly like we I don't know like if I could trust the compass but this would be pointing to the to the West what do you call this thing I've forgotten um Amphitheater looks like this could be just a Amphitheater this doesn't have those sides so I'm not sure but I'm going to first put here I'm thinking we're thinking of some other Amphitheater that right now I can remember which one you would maybe see some mountains but where is the city you can't see any of the city itself which Amphitheater is this so it's it's not this one I don't think it's this one on the left you would have buildings there's quite a lot of amphitheaters here we also have um Amphitheater so if we were here we were looking West there would be mostly the city but possibly also just not visible and then to the left you would have a hill but to the right well there could be just trees in front okay I'm I'm giving up yeah I can't crack this one I don't think it's the one in Athens but maybe it's this one here there's quite a few places where it could be I looked at all The Usual Suspects and I couldn't find it maybe I'm supposed to think of something specific like yeah but I I nothing comes to mind right now so um let's see how he does this is quite hard because you either know it or you don't and you certainly ain't gonna if you know where the the replica is you're just a nerd really but anyway I'm having fun so this guy is called Mehmet Abbasi so I'm guessing this is the fake Coliseum that's uh interesting idea that this would be a Coliseum fake call assume I mean I guess it could be well I mean it's just a ruin it could somebody's idea of a fake Coliseum but this is this I don't think this is a fake this is a this is an Amphitheater just a normal Amphitheater uh but I guess it could also be like a fake Coliseum sure they call the same or at least a Coliseum so uh he hasn't really said anything I just decided that uh I'm not going to go with the guest that I did because I don't think this is this makes any sense um this is rather maybe somewhere in an island it could be something like Cyprus I'm just gonna go because I I don't think I don't know where am I supposed to like guess but uh this is just somewhere in the boonies I think with some mountains so let's go into Cyprus and hope for the best instead uh I think it's more interesting than going like 100 kilometers off of Athens just because you don't think it's Athens so let's see what happens it could be a number of countries those trees do look Italian to me but could be turkey oh look at this yeah I saw that text but it didn't tell me anything and I'm pretty sure it's just the name of the companies I mean if anything that kind of sounds Serbian noise or something although they would have the Cyrillic ah what about Croatian are there any are there any colosseums in Croatia the Roman Empire in Croatia what stamp what Mark did they make that's what I want to know you know what I'm not doing very well I'm I'm kind of going with my heart today I'm going to keep with that yeah hi um you might have noticed that I got frozen in a very pensive position so you might think that I died or something you might have watched with anxiety oh I ran out of battery on my iPhone that I use for camera I didn't know this so unfortunately the last couple of minutes is gonna be without the camera I don't think you're losing that much you can still watch still wizard he's very handsome it's all good I I like that we both have done pretty poorly in fact so um I think it's nice to just try something different that's part of the reason why I went to Cyprus instead of just a little bit left of of Evans uh if you don't know then make some interesting guess my my guess of Mogadishu was certainly interesting but you could also try not to be really stupid I've never heard of a an episode theater did I say Coliseum earlier yeah sorry I didn't mean Colosseum policy it went all the way around didn't it any of the trees up at the top sorry for frustrating you um with my choices of words as usual I no longer know what this is a copy of but it's a Roman thing I'm gonna go somewhere around split as I say I don't know of any Roman amphitheaters in Croatia but why not It's gotta be one and I'm gonna go Solano I'm so sorry if this is in Italy oh that's interesting um it was in Turkey he did mention that the person who made the the picture was

gonna be another um lingo gas and so I'm a little you know slow sometimes they don't speak Arabic in Iran they speak Farsi or Persian Layman like me like an uncivilized person like me doesn't really recognize the difference between the Farsi and the rapid script so sorry for everyone who does and things that that's really an insult to to civilization and to humanity that I'm like yeah that's a rabbit script whatever yeah yeah it happens yeah try to distinguish between Finnish and Estonian but but it's really quite interesting because because the upside down heart was actually the key to all of it like like like a heart is sometimes a key like like or you know sometimes something is a key to someone's heart in this case the heart was the key to to to to some thing um yeah that that there was an analogy there but it kind of kind of ran away from me anyway the upside down heart is indeed a number but not in a rapid script that's why I hadn't seen it before it's a number in Persian script and that's why it is indeed specific to Tehran so the fact that I would find an upside down heart on the picture was actually a dead giveaway that this is the run and I was right of course all of that my friend is pure luck because I didn't know any of it but in any case when in doubt follow your upside down heart that you see on the map yeah got that kids at home if you don't know nothing just look at something that looks weird and similar and just run with it unless it's someone who looks really weird like a guy it looks kind of like your dad in that it is a guy then don't run with that guy foreign yeah so don't do that kids but otherwise I think that's Sound Advice this channel gives you as it is you get the geoghasm you get the lingo gasm you get the data you get the information you get the explanation you get the sweet sweet salivation The salivation Good Vibration and excitation whatever I I've I've lost all my words I would give all my words to you but I have lost them so if you see my words let me know I need to go bye bye yes it's the final round ah we get one of these things is that the Gibraltar by any chance surely not never been there but um so this guy this guy looks like tuko from uh Breaking Bad from from behind I I'm pretty sure it's too cold so let's stay away from that these look like the the things that that are used for for airports some sort of um they help with uh with the navigation or whatever a lot of building going on here quite a lot of building building building um otherwise this looks very like not very big to be honest but I guess the the city has to be somewhere behind that Hills more or less the Sun is in the North very clearly so don't keep router what are you guys building in there Islands hmm this one is very difficult southern hemisphere there is uh some sort of a peninsula going to the west and then possibly as a sea going in I'm thinking of um outskirts somehow of Rio De Janeiro or something like this and the Mongoose remind me of that so let's that's not the capital of course silly me capital of Brazil is not Rio Janeiro so there goes that idea also the sea is very comfortably to the West Northwest Southwest but this guy doesn't look particularly black so I don't think we are in in this area we would rather than be here could be theoretically be Lima [Music] um if we were here there would be some big island there like this and smaller one [Music] to the South you know that's too far Maybe that could theoretically track if this is that area and then another but not really not really this one comes out quite a lot so there's no way if we look well if you look straight to the South from here you could see this island so if we were here but there's like an Beach here on the South Side could this be a beach uh not really it doesn't look like anybody's there but let's keep that in mind [Music] um let's keep Lima in mind three minutes later tuko where are you [Laughter] cool the Sun is indeed in the North [Music] you have to use something Crown Plaza could be one of them Islands somewhere [Music] part Morris B [Music] and that could be to the West this sort of thing with the road going around it South uh East an island [Music] like this straight to the east where's East now is this the is this um thread to the West I mean is another Island could be this one well this is this is a huge Gamble oh yeah I am not screaming because my daughter is asleep Jesus Christ what right next to the place called lucky lucky lucky lucky wow wow Jesus Christ that was probably the most Geographic geographm of all time immediately as I saw this I thought that that fits with this little island here with this island stare but Jesus who who could have fought Bert Morris B had you even heard of Port modus had you even heard of Bart Morris B before this sometimes people say oh it can't be true it must be cheating I thought the same thing sometimes but you know when you play this a lot yeah you know sometimes you just wave them but sometimes you get lucky so let me explain at least a little bit here um so I did get kind of like okay so we are in southern hemisphere so we we have a limit here we're southern hemisphere although I was looking a bit up of that as well because the sun wasn't so so clear we have not like a black person um we had a capital city that all is already there's less than 200 of them facing western and southern sea so it has to look so that the sea is to the west and to the South it turns out there's not so many of them I mean ", "points":

despite it frequently falling below minus 30 it also receives about a sixth of reger's annual rainfall okay interesting so clearly very dry well we're clearly in Mongolia um very dry and yeah very high variation in temperature as like in here that's doesn't sound like a pleasant place to live in that's for sure um so where in Mongolia might we be and there even is a flag here oh there's some interesting script on that house it doesn't look like the the usual Mongol script and I'll be honest I'm not entirely sure what would that imply um probably somewhere closer to some border maybe uh possibly or some some local local language possibly um I don't see anything on like that on the map though so I don't think that's too helpful since I don't know what it means okay so we have some

we have kilometers per hour we have yellow line sun to the South so I think we would be in Canada so we're looking at a different subdivision so we're we we're somewhere on the border of provinces so it's a little bit hilly but not too mountainous so I don't think it would be Alberta uh British Columbia border this it's it's way more mountainous than this I feel I think it might be uh too heilly for this but I'll still have a look and the uh the yeah the the other part of the Clue the the town is named after a fictional character and you can definitely tell when you find it you tell okay so the road is going kind of like like slightly Northwest so I don't think any of these roads would align could it be somewhere here welcome to Alberta sign but there isn't any town there so that wouldn't be it quite a lot of roads but but nothing that grabs my tension here on the saskatch one Alberta border onion onion lake is a great name but it doesn't fit the bit the hint unfortunately nothing interesting there okay I don't think it is the Alberta Saskatchewan border let's have a quick look here on Manitoba saskatch one if anything grabs my attention another thing that concerns me maybe it's a fictional character I don't know that's another thing is I don't think I know too many fictional characters but I imagine if the name sounds like a like a character maybe um maybe I'll still recognize it so what do we okay there are some cities here fenlon and criton flon would a flylon be a character I don't know maybe in some some cartoon Flint fla I've never heard of flint flon in my life would the road align turn slightly to the West there and slightly to the east in the north doesn't work there would it be somewhere here do we have do we have houses along the road I don't see them but there there is a road here like a small one there isn't a road here so do we have an so is that is that a like a petrol station or okay I'll do a Qui quick quick additional scan I mean blin flon sound sounds like maybe maybe is some sort of a character but I've never heard of Flint flon before might be a Canadian thing Canada I don't think Canadians and and and latians get the same cartoons maybe not probably not I think that Flint fla might be my best guess here I don't see anything else that that really would work so maybe that road does fit maybe that small Road just isn't on

little bit okay yeah I mean I I could have noticed but I didn't yeah but but that's that that was a good one so 235,000 though I'm I'm very happy with this score feel like you I feel like you had a good effort I was particularly impressed how quickly you got the Estonia but I tried to be a bit ambitious including a Baltic location I guess the pole gave it away for me and just The Vibes the Baltic Vibes I don't know I just I knew you had the Vib I'm from here so I get the Vibes time for The Unofficial map let's see what unofficial locations you have prepared oh interesting Kier Mir okay so what's what's happening here you are looking down at a diamond mine it is one of the largest excavated holes in the world mining has now ceased but the name of the mine written on the hill does give a clue to the name of this Northern Town interesting this is such an interesting location I think ker Mir well ker like ker like like I don't know the exact definition but in carer you like like you mine for things usually uh and me is like me was the world I think in r in Russian um diamond mine you say so I know you like the biggest diamond manufacturer I think is Botswana I think the second largest might be Russia if I remember correctly so with cilic I think what from what I can see I could see this being Russia um I don't see why not kind of the houses definitely feel like they could be in Russia and with cilic with the diamonds diamond mining hint I think Russia is definitely my best option here so he said the name gives the clue um about the the town doesn't look like a too big of a town pretty flat it seems I would probably go in the Asian part of Russia somewhere uh not not too close to the mountains though I did mention in the clue that the it is a Northern Town oh Northern okay so I should look more Northern thank you so anything starting with me or something that shows up m m maybe and Russia has so many towns that it's inevitable that some will have similar names so I wouldn't be surprised this this part I feel like is too mountainous I don't think it could be there would it be anywhere here another M another mney so I'm not I I I don't have my Russian Vibes on point I'm not sure which Vibes fit better both of the towns would be kind of Northern my first thought was the the Asian Russia so should I go with my G I think I'll use my lucky coin got got my lucky coin so heads heads Heads is Asian Russia City tails is European Russia okay it's heads I'm going European Russia then got to trust my lucky coin on this one wait but I I I guess I can align wait why am I using my coin when I can have a look maybe the the thing is on the map I Pro probably should have done that first um before before the coin yeah I don't know why why that didn't OCC occur to me so where where was the other Mir it was somewhere here meu oh meu miruga is also an option no but that's too small that is too small there's nothing literally when you zoom in um where was M it was somewhere around here no how did I find it like so quickly first time and now I don't see it zoom out zoom out even more you can see it oh oh it's that that visible yeah it's a big town airport is there okay there is di Metro Russia Mina Mina would be a mine uh almasi ker Almas I think was like a some sort of a gem I'm not sure if it meant diamond or not but it definitely says like a ker here Kier Mir so I think okay I think this is the one I don't think the other one fits I'm I'm glad I didn't trust my lucky coin and I decided to to investigate this further okay nice

main Highway you say yeah okay not the fanciest Main Highway maybe but not not the fanciest I've seen I'll be honest yeah I I'm not sure which country uses orange license plit to be honest so that's that's an issue here there isn't much else to go by so which side okay I don't see the steering wheel on this side for this car at least so that would make me think we're driving on the right side cuz I'm not sure probably some car is is has been bro has bro is broken so people are helping out looks quite Green from what I can see lots of greenery grass so nothing too dry so wouldn't be mly or anything like that I don't think Nigeria ever or Benin maybe Benin seems like a Green Country I have no idea about the license PL colors though but it feels to me like it would be somewhere in kind of this this kind of western western Africa region maybe maybe like Central African Republic as well Cameroon one of the Congos maybe I I have no idea I'm just naming countries at this point I was I was hoping you would know the orange license plate um thing but I will give you a clue in the absence of that you have mentioned the correct country so far I have okay I have mentioned it so which

maybe a quick look maybe I notice a town similar to zigzag so this is the main highway so let's look along some highways do I see anything similar to zigzag I don't see anything like that in Benin in Nigeria I feel like the highways look better I don't think it's Nigeria uh Cameroon anything zigzag like which one would be the main Highway wait oh camon goes all the way here but I imagine it might be too dry up there Central African Republic not too many places starting with the letter Z let's go maybe Central African Republic near Cameroon somewhere there ar oh there is a z Place starting with z at least I think that's the first one I've seen so I don't think it is there but let's just let see go go there oh it is up here I said it wouldn't be oh my god zigu oh wow damn oh that's a great name oh but it's so small it really shows up when you really zoom in very closely okay that's why I didn't see it interesting that's a that's a cool name for sad when he said no it won't be there well

wow okay but they have top virtual tours okay not not helpful so we have very somewhere very green so we're looking onto Indian Ocean this is definitely giving me Island Vibes right off the bat and we have some islands islands in the distance as well that's the national park St Anne National Park and some smaller Islands here as well looks pretty nice actually bunch of wind wind generators and and and very tropical very green seems like a nice place okay well I guess let's just zoom in on a few few Islands this seems a little bit like mountainous so it wouldn't be malds or anything like that so we can eliminate I think British is yeah British Indian oan Territory was also super flat so would would be there ever Cocos Cocos Islands or Christmas Islands here I think they're also cus islands are very flat I think Christmas Islands mostly also pretty flat some little Hills it seems but there aren't any islands around that we would be looking towards okay what else do we have we have say shells there are a bunch of islands around so that already grabs my attention cuz there do seem to be a lot of islands do we get any oh St an St anarine National Park okay we are looking towards it so and the compass is about right I imagine yeah okay so we're in zigzag lots of zigzaggy roads but I don't see it's saying zigzag anywhere we see these islands here to our very North I think that the

did i do in total 15 800 in total which or for a map like this i'm i'm i'm okay with that so what okay let me pull up my prediction it was i actually if i was really trying to game the system i shouldn't have picked canada because canada is like the type of country where you just like either get a lot of points so get very few points true so i i had banked on that you would get closer on the canada and i put you at twenty thousand six hundred and eighty three so you would you were within five thousand points of it so you know say you had a nailed to canada it would have been pretty close but yeah yeah the canada that was quite far let's do well played we'll play it especially in the south africa and uh very nice guesses okay so this one's made to be a bit harder this one's this one's harder level oh no i thought the first one was already tricky in some rounds this one's made to be harder okay so here we have at least lower points okay fair enough yeah so we have sun to the south the first on the first glance i was thinking north america looking quite american and looking around my suspicions seem to be confirmed gonna halloween decorations they really love their halloween in in north america oh yes they do ravens is halloween celebrating in australia as well as us fiercely it really came in in like the last 15 years i would say and still still it's not that popular but yeah yeah okay he's probably similar in europe to be honest yeah it has some traction but it isn't nearly nearly as popular as it's in the u.s oh the architecture was really interesting on this round it's like boxy houses it is yeah it is and i think i noticed a um where was it well we were talking a canadian flag here in the distance michi kamau michi kamau sounds like like maybe some some native native language maybe but yeah that doesn't really help me much i suppose you could probably find that thing all over that type of thing all over canada i assume probably uh again we we don't have front blades [Laughter] which tells you what peter it's not ontario okay it's not ontario okay good um this time with with kind of weird architecture i was thinking a little bit hilly i was thinking maybe kind of eastern canada could it be like newfoundland maybe not very happy with that guess maybe something like like or here and more north you don't really get coverage there do you i could see you picking like cape breton islands like the very edge of it or something like that i don't know let's guess here because i'm thinking maybe it's in this area so let's see it then okay not too bad oh i wasn't thinking up there because i don't ever see coverage from from from that providence it's new oh it's a new coverage interesting i think i don't i don't think um labrador really had any before and they got this road covered in gen 4 so oh interesting yeah i was not aware of that churchill falls well at least i wasn't too far three thousand points that's for ", "points": 2959, "distance":

specific subdivision state or problems oh okay most southern right okay oh this number on the house i don't know reminds me of north america i'm not sure um i'm thinking maybe canada but i can't read what it says ah this is a tricky one i picked them to be tricky yeah that's the whole point mine will be tricky as well so you you will see also what the hell is this thingy well i don't want to waste my my power-ups just just yet so i am thinking maybe canada so the southern point of the subdivision so i i think the subdivisions maybe provinces possibly uh which province though yeah that's what i'm referring to provinces or states well this looks pretty flat i don't know if this is official or not this looks official looking at the blur it looks like it could be like generation two camera so we have water to our south west it seems south west southern point of the province ontario's southern point would be like probably belly island could this be like pele island but i see no land in the distance though so this is not pele island could it be somewhere here like a mufon land maybe southern point of newfoundland somewhere here there are no roads though down here this is frustrating i don't know which i have no idea which one but okay let's go let's go with this one let's go allen's island for example i don't but that's not this is southern fine let's go back shore oh my god okay

that's smaller than newfoundland oh yeah well that's the islands yeah okay hmm oh yeah this i mean this is is official um we have white lines all white lines so where is the sun you gotta check the sun sun is kinda to the south sun is to the south hmm kind of hilly looking sun to the south smaller than newfoundland i am thinking could this be like one of the canary islands can we see i can't tell if those like reflectors are yellow or not they might be yellow and if they are yellow [Music] okay i think i will use one of my lifelines and i will ask you is is this wait which one should i use um so you've got the hemisphere you've got the uh continent and you've got the um the uh oscar for if the country is correct [Music] okay i will ask if this is spain uh this is not in spain oh okay so these are not canary islands it's not canary islands i i totally uh agreed with your like reasoning and everything but no it's not canary islands damn that was my best guess what the hell is this then i was thinking that this might be chile maybe all white lions chile can look quite similar to spain and if you have designed for this to be tricky i guess this this counts as an island right it does it does and is this is kind of similar to size i think it is smaller yeah the newfoundland so maybe i mean but the sun is to the south i mean sun is kind of in the middle though it's with these clouds is very tricky to know i i think the sun i have to trust the sun now it's not chill i have to trust the sun here what the hell is it then okay all white lines no car visible no antenna if it's not spain could it be portugal azores where was the water water was to our west okay i think i'll go azores because i mean they are pretty like also hilly as well let's go somewhere up here maybe i i don't have a better guess so let's go ah sardinia okay well i'm glad i'm glad i trusted the sun at least yeah true true that was a good play much better points than had you gone chilly that's true that one was really interesting because i was surprised when i found such red soil over in sardinia yeah definitely there itself made me think that it might be like uh one of these these islands ",

looks very russian very rough and with this long antenna with this yellow pipe uh also with these like blue blue colored uh windows you see this blue color a lot in uh like not only only russia but like eastern european countries as well um blue roofs and if the year-long temperature average temperature is negative well it must be pretty pretty northern more monsk could it be somewhere here like the thing with russia is that like this part doesn't have much coverage at all yeah that's true so if we are very northern it is more likely to be somewhere here in the western part so i'll give you a further clue which is basically what i've already said but um this is i believe uh the coldest city in the world oh oh interesting i think as far as i know if only i knew which what was the which was the call the city of the world that would be very helpful right now why is this person rocking around with a t-shirt what the hell the coldest city in the world i think it still gets up to 15 degrees night of summer so they're probably i guess during the summer i guess so yeah well well there is no snow i don't know but the coldest city of the world i was thinking like svalbard probably is colder than this but i mean this is rush i think uh sombra doesn't have any cities though uh like i think it's it's not talking about towns it's talking about proper cities doesn't isn't this like longier i don't know i don't know i guess with the definition of steady being more than like 30 000 people or something like that because even even newark doesn't have uh more than like 20 000 i don't think so yeah well this definitely isn't more mansk itself it looks smaller but i'm thinking maybe it's somewhere nearby this is kind of like risking it a lot but i feel like i have to risk it yeah okay so i will ask about the continent then is this this is in asia is in asia okay okay that's very useful knowledge then mm-hmm and then it's oh god i don't know which of these cities have even coverage here oh i will just give you a final hint i'll give you a final hit this uh this i believe this uh city has more than a hundred thousand people in it a hundred thousand people i believe so hmm so usually pretty big city as well any big cities up here well from the coverage it certainly doesn't look like a city with hundred thousand people i would have never thought it's that big yeah um so yeah it has it has almost three hundred thousand people yeah wow okay let's go i don't know let's go yaku it's kind of kind of for hedging purposes as well if it's more to the east or to the west i'm kind of kind of here kind of kind of central yeah let's go wow it was yakuza wow i mean i couldn't have done it without your hands to be honest no no no i think i think that's a good one because it's so

for me already enough doesn't even really go below zero where i live i wouldn't i wouldn't deal with that okay so the clue for this round is that uh the um the vegetation is not typical of the country hmm so let's have a look where the sun is the sun is to the north so that could be helpful sun is to the north and generation 2 which also helps because in southern hemisphere there really aren't too many countries with generation two camera southern hemisphere well i don't think this is south africa doesn't feel like south africa at all what else do we have we have some brazil australia some new zealand as well i think with the gen 2 and that's it i was thinking could this be like australia or new zealand i was thinking somewhere around there maybe i'm thinking possibly new zealand because i know new zealand can sort of look similar to baltics in a way and this feels a little bit similar it does have a boat with this road yeah yeah i have had some locations where new zealand feels eerily similar to baltics um except that sun is to the north so with gen 2 and potentially it could be australia but i mean i i have to guess one of one or the other there's no point guessing in the middle in the sea i have i have seen some people guess in the middle to get point a little bit more points i feel like it's worth risking because if you guess in the sea you lose a lot of points either way yeah they're deceptively far apart it is pretty hilly i don't see any like high mountains though so i will still go with northern ireland i think i go with i'll go with southern part of northern new zealand let's see ah it was australia ah chose the wrong one in my state of south australia that is an infamous uh an infamous region in my community just because of how strange it looks there's lots of pine plantations over there near my gambia yeah it definitely doesn't look like your typical australia yeah at least i'm glad i got the like correct region of the world ", "points": 667,

thought when i saw this was uh like south america so and if we can see pacific ocean so it's not brazil good to know because i was considering brazil but with these little houses could it be indonesia with the yellow line though oh god which set are we driving on oh no oh no the first thought was does it count i think it counts as indian ocean though yeah okay so it's not it shouldn't be indonesia since it's an indian ocean there okay so let's return our thought process to south america then these houses felt very asian to me but yeah the pacific ocean wouldn't work with asia then would it be peru i don't think it would be chiller with the yellow lines so central yellow lines if you have no antenna ecuador these these uh arrows were reminding me of ecuador but could it be one of the ecuadorian islands though oh are you tricky and take going with some islands would it be here maybe could it be does it align i don't know if there is even kind of coverage here to be honest i'm just looking at the roads and trying to align them or is this just the mainland ecuador or is this not even an ecuador what is this i don't even know if this place is it has coverage but i think this would be a place that you might choose just to be tricky just to be tricky there are comments field in their comments no comments yeah yeah this is such a risky guess though oh my god such a risky guess but i mean there is a pacific ocean to our south as well so i think i'll have to i i will risk it i have to risk it i feel let's let's go all right oh no oh no oh no it was mainland ecuador ah god damn it you weren't as tricky as that sweating i was absolutely talking because uh when i realized that this was the last round and uh you're gonna ask for which uh hemisphere it's in uh actually forgot

get it let's go so unofficial no moving the clue is that this island has a population of 32 in the summer and 16 in the winter 32 in the summer and 16 in the winter wow approximately of course [Music] this is tricky i was watching like a documentary a while ago about some some canadian fishing town that also has like super small population but this is probably not it we have some pretty high mountains here yeah that's going to help for sure yeah well it definitely helps a little bit helps to eliminate a few places but because i imagine many of those canadian fishing towns wouldn't have such big mountains in the background if they're in the hudson bay or something um that is true i mean i'm not even sure if this is actually canada though this might be it might be like greenland norway of course you have your three power-ups as well so yeah noise oh this might be the type of ram where you want to go for one looking for there's absolutely no text no nothing you've chosen a good location architecture architectural geography i'm not very good with architecture though that that's that's my my downfall okay i am i don't think these houses look very very nordic i think like in norway the houses would look different i am leaning canada with this mountain remember this is an island well this is an island oh i mean yeah there are some there's 32 in this oh okay yeah thank you i miss missed that part yeah um i am thinking that i'm i am thinking that this might be one of these islands like on the western part of british columbia maybe oh no idea which one with such a small population maybe it's like finn island there are absolutely no no towns though marked there i think a lot of these bc islands are uninhabited yeah it looks like that looks like they are not i mean maybe it's like us as well maybe it's like one of these towns doesn't have to be canada could be us alaska somewhere in this area that's my best guess somewhere in this area so let's let's see

looking at the the uh flora looking at the surroundings this might be some well since it's constructed by europeans it um probably is in europe constructed by ukrainians um well by the way you still have three power-ups left so you can actually three power-ups use yeah you can actually use um one of them that's around guaranteed yeah so well the hemisphere i'm pretty sure i know the hemisphere uh continent i'm pretty sure i know the continent i am wondering wait i think i see this uh bollard this is a latvian bollard it is a latvian pollard um so yeah this is like i don't know where that telescope like the radio satellite is though lpg i was thinking uh that it means like latvia's propanagas or something so um i don't know where it is though that's the thing this looks kind of coastal probably with these like like dunes sure yeah yeah maybe it's all the way here on this coast i feel like if it was closer to riga i would have probably visited at some point since i'm from riga myself maybe it's like close to leopard that's a relatively big city artillery battery number one there are some some army things here maybe it's somewhere around here can i tell you something sure you have you have indeed figured out the country and i was literally going to choose a uh location at artillery battery number one and then chose not to chose not to use it that's an insane coincidence actually damn that's crazy yeah i i i don't know where this unfolds i i have heard of this place just just for hedging let's go somewhere maybe more like here closer to riga okay let's go kind of here let's do it okay it was okay i don't know ah here we go okay yeah you really need to zoom in for it to show up ", "points": 4803, "distance": 60.0, "challenge_info": {"challenge": {"token":

this country uses orange license plates yeah we that is i don't know which countries use orange license plates unfortunately not not only the official coverage can i find some writing maybe see fortunately you still have all your hints left yeah that is true on this round two i probably will use at least one of them on this round i'll let you i'll let you use uh two on a single round if you if you so desire because you've been frugal with them so far um okay i think i will ask the continent this one is in africa africa okay yeah i wasn't sure i was thinking these houses feel a little bit asian so i was wasn't sure if it's africa or not yeah okay so we are in africa yay okay and i will ask also which hemisphere this is this is in the northern hemisphere northern hemisphere okay so that kind of kind of helps a lot knowing that we're in northern africa like the equatorial line divides it very neatly in half orange plates i don't know about that and i don't know which side we are driving either unfortunately yeah it's just obscured by the sun [Music] that's unfortunate the steering wheel yeah i don't know if the windshield wipers are the other direction if you're driving if the steer is on the right side yeah i've no idea i've never thought about that i'm just thinking though the only the only um countries in africa in the northern hemisphere that drive left are kenya and uganda anyway and neither of them is also a good point yeah also a good point yeah yeah i guess like it would make sense that windshield wipers would be the other direction if the steering wheel is on the other side uh i don't know i'm feeling cameroon is calling my name i don't know why i'm not sure if cameroon has orange plates or not but i feel like cameroon is calling my name let's go

the wait for you so hang in there um yeah we're on schedule for a pre-christmas release date so all is good on that front meanwhile it's going to be another play-along video for you guys to enjoy and this is one that i i did do a while ago and it got a fair amount of views 600 000 views on the channel so i think it's high time i did another one and it's called interesting photo spheres in obscure countries yeah one round in particular springs to mind i was sure we were in a spanish city so i was scouring the coast of spain turns out we were in a huge algerian city that i'd never heard of so let's hope that there's more surprising intriguing and interesting photo spheres like that today let's play it no moving no time limit let's do it where are we going to pop out today okay here we go it okay is that okay it was taken by a dude called jean-pierre garcia and i can't really escape the names in the bottom right i mean my eyes will just be drawn to it i'm wondering if this is palmyra i don't know but palmyra springs to mind i remember it on top gear when jeremy james and hamster drove i can't quite remember that they drove they made their own race track or something or they drove around here but of course since then palmyra was destroyed by those buggers isis so i don't know whether this whether this is palmyra but this photo sphere predates that which is i think unlikely because that probably got destroyed in about 2014 or this isn't palmyra in which case i don't really know where it would be if truth be told but it could easily be a roman structure in anywhere palestine israel turkey but the people we're seeing i think i'm muslim yeah yeah i think so it's hard to say i mean that's a headscarf a muslim attire i think but that doesn't mean we're not in palestine jordan even so let's i'm going to go into palmyra if i can find it which i think is in syria again i i do have to point out that i am well not only did i have a few beers on the weekend so my head's a bit cloudy anyway but i'm not playing a lot of geoguesser i'm only editing so it's a total i'm using it as a get out of jail card if i do anything embarrassing geography wise um anyway so where's palmyra basically i bet i won't find it will i there's damascus i mean where is it i don't know where it is might have to speed this up got it okay it's in the middle of nowhere there it is there is a town around here you know there's there's normal buildings which we do have let's have a look at this then so according to this the town is slightly to the north of the of whatever you would call this and there's mountains in the north as well do we have mountains yes we do uh but of course as we've learned the compass can be wrong compass definitely can be wrong palmyra airport can't see that but basically there's a lot of temples down here i would say it's all of this one thing i will say is how badly did they destroy this i mean how badly can you destroy it i mean i guess you could blow it up with sticks of dynamite and bombs and really destroy it couldn't you i guess but you'd need a lot of heavy i mean is this post ex you know post destruction or pre i don't know maybe they did a bit of a [\u00a0__\u00a0] job of it who knows but i am i've got to go for this now i've got to go for it is it anything else here i can use at all it does look like we're in a temple of sorts i'll go i'll go there no i'm going to go back where i was oh my god we're nowhere near we are nowhere near okay so what's probably happened is palmyra did get destroyed and there are probably no photo spheres remaining of it or if there are i'd like to see them no we are in algeria again so we finally get to see what that city was called in my last video iran there it is iran i thought it i was convinced it was in spain but we are in the same country and we are in a place called tim gad tim gad not steve gad no tim gad and there it is it's a roman amphitheater so it's not babylonian i don't know what palmyra actually is but it's a roman one and it kind of did look quite roman but i never would have found that not in a million years well done if you got that who the hell got that

might be portugal no it could no it probably we'll figure it out it's either portugal or brazil but what have we got here sal rai rabil they do sound more portuguese to me and i'd say that the the signs are european as well but i hope i'm right about that god this is interesting maybe okay yeah she's she looks like a tourist possibly a british tourist very pink skinned compared to this woman for example zhao gallego buffarera okay where's the sun because we could be on an island somewhere that's what i'm thinking at the moment sun isn't really making itself known black guy as well and another pretty dark-skinned guy would point more to brazil i i don't know and then the registration plates ah tui tui they are two evans so i would say this is portugal but kind of quite remote because it's a tui kind of safari not safari but you know excursion and there's another one there as well so this i'm thinking this could be a touristy kind of village a bit inland in the algarve right so i'm going to search near the sea in southern portugal then i will go from there okay wish me luck [Music] okay that's interesting i think i think i've ruled out portugal because this is just obviously so hot here yeah that will do me for now so i'm going over to which i'm not completely hopeful about but i'm going over to these um and i'll try this out again i'll speed it up because i'm conscious of the time that this all could take so speeding this up i am in funchal right no funchal is here here we go [Music] hmm yeah it's not looking good not least because it's very flat very very flat the more i look at this the more it looks like brazil but i just don't know at the moment um but yeah that's a very mountainous island is madeira not funchal that's the capital uh so i'm heading over to these now which i think at least in part are also owned by portugal yeah sao miguel right so i'll have a little search here bear with me [Music] okay that is all of the azures done even these ones out here uh so so we've got to be in brazil that's my thought process i don't where am i gonna search here man where am i gonna search god damn okay it still feels like we're on an island somehow okay i'm gonna just skim the coast of brazil quite loosely and see if i find anything that i think i've seen because there's a lot on these signs there's a lot [Music] okay i can go back to that i think there's an island i think there is an island off the coast somewhere please be an island how about this one no can't be here can it cabo verde i guess it could be i'm starting to think it could be [Music] okay we're not on that island there are other ones there's quite a few i'm gonna go on the top one first i've got something gat ass there it's promising but it ain't it's good but it's not quite right at the moment [Music] [Applause] oh oh have we got it i'm sure i saw that sal rai sal rai come on this has to be a rabil come on yes i knew i was onto something here this is why it looked in my defense across between portugal and brazil right but what was really playing on my mind was these vehicles you know the black registrations and the fact that they're there's just a convoy of like four by fours told me that we weren't we're somewhere weird but somewhere that you might go on holiday nonetheless anyway let's try and find it now finally he's too wet we should be able to do this i just need some of my geo guessing ability to come back a bit found this cabeco dos tarafes jiao gallego i found that finally so zhao gallego is that way oh my god man either things aren't very well mapped on here or i've got monumentally confused i think part of the reason i'm getting confused is the compass is probably wrong to be fair thunder i think we might be here you know all in all i just think the i think the compass is wrong but we probably are here i think we're about there yes oh my god that was so confusing so obviously i would have sped that up a bit for you because that took me ages to figure out uh firstly to figure out that we're in cabo verde um but then secondly actually where the hell we were on that particular island in cabo verde because ", "points": 5000,

people say oh my god i did not expect an islamic hang on a minute we are in pakistan allama iqbal faculty of arts kabul university wait a minute um so we're not in pakistan we're in kabul but i'm still confused as to why it's snowing what do i know um yeah there's an afghanistan flag right let's get to work with this let's try and make this a bit quicker this particular round kabul to be fair is quite yeah i mean you're not a million miles from well the himalayas quite frankly it's probably quite high above sea level and near places like tajikistan which is very mountainous so kabul you hear it a lot in the news and you presume it's hot and maybe it is in the summer but sure as that ain't hot at the moment so let's see if we can find this very distinctive looking building there this is a good one so we're looking for a university and in particular a llama iqbal faculty of arts kabul university okay search for a minute and then i'll speed it up if i haven't found it so i'm looking for yeah some of these official looking places um [Music] universities what do they look like on the map yes we've got a few here kardan university salam university are we recording we are embassy of pakistan let's also look at the layout of the road here it's running north to south there's one running north to south zowell but it ain't that we don't think okay i'm gonna keep searching in this manner and i'll speed it up for you [Music] okay right i found kabul university so i think we're probably around here somewhere um seeing as i've found nothing else anywhere else faculty of arts so we've got science journalism physics so it's only a matter of time i mean that that looks a lot like it look at that faculty of arts but look at the building social science are you sure i think that could be it you know the road it's going directly north but slightly northwest which is also true of that for me that's the building so i'm going for it 18 yards come on get in excellent stuff yep pretty obvious um thought process the whole way through there just a matter of finding it and finding that distinctive building shape i said that at the start um well done if you got that let's move on to the penultimate round right okay now straight away iran wow iran i'm not sure i've ever had iran before this is a complete first afghanistan i don't know if i had that before either if i'm perfectly honest but anyway we're in iran this might be pretty tricky but presumably we are in the capital tiran right maybe not maybe not it's a pretty developed country this could be somewhere else for all i know i can't quite read that street name all i've got is mama mercy as a shop name that is all i've got and that bosh it's a boss shot there's a drill up there okay so bosh mama mercy mercy mama and that which alludes to some scales so it could be a that could be a prison look at the fence or it could be a court of law yeah look so we've got some stuff but yeah i don't know let's go to iran here what what cities do we like we could easily be in shiraz isfahan mashhad but i'm going into tehran i'll go into tehran and because look i'm not going to find this realistically and i haven't got time to search for hours and hours if i search for that hours and hours i could find it but i just haven't got the time unfortunately and i just don't see me finding this unless i just happen to chance upon i mean the roads are adding up but unless i chance upon a law court or a boss shop in the next few seconds really i wonder if that thing there alludes to tehran do you know what i think it does i'm talking about this let's get them lined up not quite but if we go to another city uh isfahan has got the same at the start for some reason i guess it's oh i guess that's the an because it's backwards isn't it i think um i wonder if we can get it from that gorgon look it's making sense are there any other ands that one no it's not making any more sense than the original one tehran so yeah i'm gonna stick to that you never know i'm gonna give myself a couple of minutes here to yeah to just see if i can stumble across this prison [Music] okay i'm gonna go here because there's something there i don't know what it is and i can't find anything better um it's a very big city so yeah i can't find anything better and that's about as much time as i'm willing to spend as i search even more yeah no well done if you got this guys but i couldn't i couldn't go on much longer here we go here's my guess we might not even be in tehran we were in tehran and we were up here oh my god well that's not the direction i thought the road was going at all there's a government office there there's a tool store i'll give you that tool store ", "points": 4990, "distance": 3.0, "challenge_info":

back to the good stuff we're heading back to the juicy stuff interesting photo spheres in obscure countries yet to get a perfect score on this as you can see 19785 is the best i've done so far but i've only played it twice this is good though because it means i've got a real challenge i love a good challenge let's do this if you are new around here um and you want to play along i recommend you do it's really fun follow the instructions in the description uh oh we're going i've clicked start here we go yes first one there's no way i'm going to get a perfect score today this this is a really hard map it's really tough okay here we go i'm gonna need luck i'm gonna need favorable rounds right what have we got here looks like we might be in africa judging by these dudes who look pretty damn african this guy has got i think that's a horrible psg shirt aren't there that almost looks like an african badge there but i think it's just light coming through the van yeah ignore that um yeah just scanning these guys for any clues that they might have this guy's got an interesting hat on a muslim hat i would say right but then over here we have tourists and i think they're chinese tourists not judging by how they look but rather the name down here of the person who took the photo looks pretty chinese to me right oh god and as usual we've got some writing that is just tantalizingly illegible i can't tell what what what language it is all i want to know is what language it is at the very least um right some of the rocks we've got on the floor here look like they might be quite volcanic we've got a [\u00a0__\u00a0] the remnants of a fire probably not too sensible got a woman here chinese or japanese taking a selfie i mean yeah it doesn't take a genius to work out that this is a volcano caldera the sun we can't really use and that's it guys that is about it apart from this okay so this let's see where the c is this is semi useful to see i'm still getting used to this compass ah yes lots of you commented didn't you classic compass on resume game yes come on get in right that's north that is north interesting i wouldn't have said north let's get in and and see if we can have a look would it be madagascar perhaps i don't know it could be any of these things couldn't it comoros what we're looking for is a pretty defined a crater a volcanic crater near a coast so yeah i guess we just scan a few coastlines until we find one this is extremely unlikely that i find this guys um wait a minute look at that that can't be it can it just as i said extremely unlikely that i find this and let me just explain why it's extremely unlikely well we could be anywhere in africa however north coast these guys it's it's the muslim looking hat and i think these are these guys also look more eastern african i don't know that's just what i'm vibing but it's this northern shoreline i'll come back to this obviously it can't be that many places you know i guess it could be there for example the north coast of that island but on the whole it can't be any of the northern coast of africa because it's too deserty can't be the south of africa because of the compass same for these bits here that's what i'm trying to say um it could only be these sorts of places around here reunion mauritius anyway i've explained myself uh to the people who will accuse and we're back here and i think this is matching up pretty well i won't lie we've got you can clearly see there's beaches down there uh and you can see the coast goes around there the road does it bend probably and we've got this container there should be a building the other side of the road which i can't see so i'm only i'm only 50 50 or less gonna have a quick look again and speed it up just to see if i find anything better yeah i've checked all the places that i i conceivably think that this could be guys so i am going to go in this place that i found so very early on this would be incredible if this is right it's right 78 yards that's incredible i'm so happy with that one i can't believe i found that so quickly ", "points": 5000, "distance": 0.0, "challenge_info": {"challenge": {"token": "attHVlv2SukKQLPW",

Karuruma"}, "split_transcript": "yeah so moment of truth here a double whammy what's the next round okay that looks promising but we cut wait can we do it yeah of course we can do it i don't know why i keep thinking we've lost loads of points more points than we have so if we get a perfect score here of course and basically we need four thousand we need four we need four thousand one hundred something like that i won't work it out exactly right this says it qui buca 25 and um of course i'm wondering how many of you are beating me here and will beat me as always let me know in the comments at the end there's the flag so we have a flag i mean this is what we need but whether that's a country or an overseas territory of another country i'm not sure it could be either because as i said earlier i'm not 100 on all those little tiny nations i'm struggling to think what that that is we've got yellow number plates but they're kind of like european shaped but definitely not european we're in a tropical sort of place those cars are is that a toyota corolla and that might even be a toyota mr2 or some or mazda maybe so potentially um asian cars we've got a fairly big city up there that's interesting pretty big city and so this cui buca qui buca it sounds to me like a sort of australasian oceanic name like out here somewhere could would be on vanuatu something like that whatever it is it's gotta be it's gonna have a fairly big capital to it as you can see up there i mean those are some pretty big buildings the main question i've got is is qui buca the name of this city if it is then great we'll find it fairly quickly i would have thought but i don't think it is because i think i would have heard of it if it's this big and built up this is just my first hunch i'm looking at places like this you know um places that i don't know much about qui buca so i can look at languages so this sounds this looks french vanuatu is a rue cornwall rue edinburgh i think there's been some real serious mixing trading of uh land there i just don't think i think these islands that i'm looking at are too small what we've got over there is so built up see that could just be the name of the street it could be a really fancy apartment that you stay in what what does the 25 stand for you know number 25 qabuka quibuca road don't know i don't think we're in samoa i don't think it's this built up so where does that leave me um ah now this this is gonna be tough but i'm so determined to get this so we've got the caribbean but qui buca for a start doesn't really remind me of the caribbean where's the sun it's kind of in the south if anything but it's pretty damn westerly we can't really use that um let me have a look through some of these caribbean places lucia barbados some vincent let me have a little look martinique is just all going to be french there's no point dominica looks pretty english as well guadalupe monsieur is small anguir u.s virgin islands right that is one big place willemstad look at that kabuto boss kabuto boss kaya there's definitely like an old language that's still got an influence here seru it's a lot of apartments here mahay i'm liking the language it does seem to fit this might be totally wrong guys we you know i don't know all right let me search this place because it's big it's built up it takes a few boxes it's built up it's obviously the right um tropicalness it's in the southern hemis it's in the northern hemisphere just the flag i can't remember it's obviously owned by the netherlands so that would make sense that i wouldn't know the flag um and also what i thought was to see out here isn't it's kind of hilly so leave it with me let me let me check i'm just looking for qui buca i'm just looking for that word because it's got to be if this if my trailer thought is right it's got to be either a road or an apartment name look at these names though nikki bocco why nappa harry [\u00a0__\u00a0] i'm gonna go for it man i'm gonna just really gamble here because while lots of things add up i really could be on the other side of the earth genuinely i don't know the flag for curacao i don't know the the license plates i don't remember guys i don't remember um there's certain things that add up which i've explained the only other thing is are we could we be somewhere in africa but i just don't think there'd be that much wealth up there look at that no way unfortunately for africa i don't think that's right so i'm just gonna go for it i literally just thought about rwanda you are kidding ", "points": 9,

World Records each location will be the location where a record was presumably set I don't know I only had a look at one so we've got to try and figure out obviously where we are that'll be the the sort of main thing but also a side challenge in this particular game will be trying to figure out which record that place holds the one I saw was pretty obvious but some of them may not be I don't know it might be a mixture I've got a bit of a cold by the way I'm sure you can tell but yeah let's have a good old play along shall we um it's been a little while if you haven't done it before instructions will be in the description give it a go it's great fun thank you to the guy who messaged me recommending this map and thank you to Century who created it in fact no I'll thank you at the end because it might be right here we go no moving for a bit of challenge bit of restriction and there we go there's a link and here's our first round and we've got a temple seems to be Indian looking but then there's a fair few white people this guy's got a Utah t-shirt on this guy's got a a maple leaf Canadian maple leaf it seems but we're definitely definitely not in the the U.S we're definitely not in Utah or Canada think it's safe to say zooming in here these look more Indian so presumably this is quite a touristy site in India Japanese women you could just tell you can just tell by the hats can you not am I right or wrong let me know in the comments we'll never know I suppose um Asian tourists although if we're in India then we are in Asia now this could be useful disco where does he look he looks like a local guide but he doesn't look Indian he looks possibly um well I'm now thinking based on his appearance that we're we're more likely in Cambodia or Thailand which would correlate with the trees these tall palm trees and yeah I've never been to either country I've never been to any of those temples so um yeah I don't know the difference basically so this I'm now thinking is probably a temple in Cambodia hmm I wonder if we can find out from this I can't read the I can't tell the difference between the the script of Thailand and Cambodia at the best of times even when it's clear as day on a sign that's Latin script so I don't know what I'm talking about I'm just trying to look for a flag or something on on his person he's a policeman isn't he somewhere between a policeman and a Boy Scout um the Hat does have the colors of both countries flags in terms of the record this could be the biggest temple in the world couldn't it I mean it's it's big and square um so if they're counting this structure even that structure I mean even that is huge so if I was to yeah put money on it I'd say biggest temple in the world or biggest Buddhist temple in the

look for another Temple and get back to you oh wait a minute I think I've got confused here I hadn't zoomed in enough I actually think we are here although I don't see that path there we've got that one there and we're actually still inside this whole area and then there's a moat so I was looking there we're actually here if we are here and that would make more sense I think um one two three yeah um yeah I think that one and that one will be those that one that one and that one will be that that and that and then we've got the two at the back yeah I think we are there um I think that would be

geoguesser video I was meant to get a Geo detective video out for you today but it's proving pesky again uh but it will be a good one something a bit different but here we are I thought I'd give this country borders map a try which we tried three or four weeks ago and had great fun with um but we were playing the satellite view today we're going to play it as a normal game and you can play along the reason I'm not doing satellite view today is because I couldn't get that to work so simple as that really I did manage to achieve kind of a perfect score I was two points off the Perfect Score because of a bug but I imagine that today that ain't going to happen it's it's going to be much harder to get a a perfect score when we're just playing it on the ground um depending on where we are we might get lucky uh but without any further Ado I'm going to make this into a challenge so that you can play along and it's going to be no moving no time limit the best way to play on this sort of map so do follow the destructions down in the inscription below it's not too late to do that fine your loss and let's play I like the look of this one I like the look of this one to begin with this is the point at which two countries converge and we're on a path this is a proper Photosphere we've got tourists we can maybe try and gauge where these people are from I think I know him nah he looks like someone who used to work in the kitchen at at Toby carv well we've got to look at this writing for a for a start maybe this gives away the the name of the water fall would be good as long as I know it it looks like the Victoria Falls it can't be Niagara Falls obviously there is another one ah wait a minute I can't remember what they're called but it begins with I Isuzu it's not Isuzu that's a car brand I'll come back to that but looking down here here we also have some spanishyo language perigo perigo the waterfall that I'm thinking of oh man I used to have an atlas with the biggest waterfalls in and this is like one of the most famous is it on the border of Argentina and Paraguay something like that it's going to be tricky to find it that there'll definitely be some speed UPS in this video where I'm trying to find things but Isuzu Falls no that's the car make again igua IGA IGA it looks like igu uaso or something um is it on the edge of Venezuela or or am I just thinking of um the angel Force well if it is the let's call them the Isuzu Falls the ones that I'm thinking of that are very famous then it should come up on the map you know with little zooming but I think I'm looking in the right area here that's Paraguay there Iguazu surely this is what I'm thinking of the igua and that would correlate with the tropical Ness of the place The Iguazu Falls where is it where is it maybe it's not that I'm doubting myself now I will'll Follow The Iguazu River however we're into Brazil there that's that's not a border this is my worry and then it's into the piran river that's not good that is not good have I made this thing up ah Las karatas Del Iguazu surely it's here surely Iguazu Falls yes oh I was looking at that and it just didn't look like a waterfall where's the waterfall I don't know what they've done with this map I don't think that's quite right I mean we've got a path here that's heading down I don't see any water down there but right we got to figure this out now I am using the old the new rather Compass system which I'm I'm just going to have to get used to so that my face can be more in the corner so that's West we're looking West although the compass might not be correct I'm glad I found the um the Falls but I really want to get this spot on cuz the perfect score is on of course okay we can do this we can do this we're looking out to the west and we've got this a very distinct path shape with what looks to be an island in the middle which you can walk over to that looks like the island but there's no path leading into it unfortunately it's making me think that the compass is wrong because also the water the way that the water's flowing seems to be flowing South no it's flowing North it's flowing North so that's correct yeah ah does that lead to that I don't think that does lead to that um Island actually when you zoom in it's nowhere near it I would say so that is that got it's got to be it's got to be which would put us kind of here so we've got this path coming down it's not really the right shape it should be more Jagged and angular than that but I would say that that's that's got to be it isn't it am I missing something no cuz we're looking to the east there Tom nothing's really adding up here to be honest I would actually put us there but there's no there's no path but looking at the shape of things I think that's where I'd put us so it's not going to be right but you know I doubt we're going to get a perfect score on here anyway but that's the best I've got that is the best I've got unfortunately and that is where my guess will be damn that is quite frustrating I didn't think that the the land protruded out that far either and that was actually just the other side that wasn't an island looked like an island

"split_transcript": "got to be a great map to play biggest lake of every country and US state I've never done anything like this so 157 locations so it's not every country in the world because I guess yeah some of them don't have the photop sphere on their biggest lake some countries don't even have a lake the Maldives Springs to mind so they've bolstered it up with us States hopefully we don't get too many US Estates and it's a nice spread but yeah I think this will be a really good challenge a very hard one actually potentially because we might just be on a boat let's make that challenge link no moving of course um and please play along if you haven't already or even if you have already you could easily beat me here that this is going to be more to do with luck than skill I think but hopefully there will be some good chances for detective work let's go we have music listen to that can you hear that might as well check if we're recording while we're at it yes we are yeah that should be quite nice and quiet for you that's hilarious that's actually really tasteful music Well Done geoguesser Right Here we are on our first Lake anyway and it's huge um it's quite Brown that is actually distracting me quite a lot we've got islands and as predicted we're on a boat um this guy is quite angrily filming it or taking photos M if you if your heart's not in it mate don't do it and yes as you often do with these photos spheres they're taken by a person and you get their name Hector Navaro and that can give us a clue fortunately in some ways that can give us a clue to where we are not always though cuz they could travel now the other glaring clue we have here is a flag green yellow and red H I'm a bit Rusty now with my Flags but Bolivia okay let's let's keep a look at the it doesn't really look like Bolivia it's oh no no Bolivia does have jungle I'll get into the map in a sec let's just look at all these Clues because you can see the flag behind this guy's head but he doesn't really look Bolivian there aren't that many black people in Bolivia Colombia yes Ecuador yes and then this dude is much darker than these guys as well so maybe we're not in South America it's going to come down to the flag the flag is going to be very helpful here I think I just hope if I can get the flag okay which way is North that way is North so we've got an island there we've got an island there to the Northwest but really we can't see a lot else that seems to go on into Oblivion over there that's kind of to the east so let's get into the map then because I just want to check Bolivia the biggest lake in Bolivia ah it depends if they are counting lakes that that straddle two countries like would that be the biggest lake for Peru and Bolivia or would they judge it on whichever area of water is predominantly in the one country either way guys I think that these are quite deserty areas and not this kind of jungly stuff that we've got going all around around the lakes here the lake you can tell it's trees I don't think that that's what you have there I think it's quite arid there is jungle in Bolivia but it's uh yeah it's not where the big lakes are right Excuse me while I try and remember the flags here so Venezuela no that's got blue in it Columbia's got blue in it and Ecuador's got blue in it it's none of the others it could be some of these Surinam that's a big lake that is a big lake okay that would make sense because they're you know they have a South American name but I just want to look at Africa because there's so many flags that that could be Ghana it can't be because it's um vertical instead of horizontal which we have senagal see because I haven't done any flag tests in a while I'm getting confused between Sagal which it can't be by the way there's one Lake one big lake in Sagal and it's in the desert Cameroon it could be this one got an island there what other man I need to think about Flags bear with me yeah Ethiopia Ethiopia Lake Tanner looks quite looks quite jungly there that's all kind of jungle isn't it kind of like Tanner let's have Let's Line these islands up this is hard we're judging it as I kind of predicted a lot of the clues are on the boat San San sellan I wonder if there's a town called San that would be good wouldn't it B here ooh nah that's North that's North the reason I'm focusing on Ethiopia is is pretty much purely because of the the facial structure of this guy and the fact that we seem to have this weird language you know this weird it's a very unique you know script can't really see it that well but also the flag obviously does have a star in the in the middle of it doesn't it or something but we can't see that he could be Ethiopian as well just don't know if you How likely are you to get two Latin Americans on holiday in Ethiopia I'm just going to check back in this Surinam one San San Browns it's like Dutch isn't it there's plenty of ISS here but I don't know about the flag of Surinam I think it's a bit different let me let me size sorry I'm taking ages on this this might be quite a difficult video right that's North I don't like the way that all the lands in the background are the position like that that Oblivion over there where's that is it down here doesn't really add up maybe the compass is wrong yeah maybe the compass is wrong okay let's imagine the compass is wrong [Music] so where's Oblivion oblivion's over there that's Oblivion so we'd be like there that's the bigger island of the two and that's the other Island yeah that makes that makes a lot more sense very often the compass is wrong on these photos spheres oh what's that yeah that's a building and right in line if we were to look this way you've got bah da which is quite a Big Town to in

the only photo so we we've got to uh got to applaud him for that oh my goodness me I thought we had a satellite like imagery then we don't it's from a drone I think but look how high up that was taken from goodness and what's good about that is we can see the shape of this Lake perfectly it's a big lake it's not like gigantic it's not as big as the last one but it's mighty big it's a reservoir because you can see the dam there but also you can always tell a reservoir because you get these these shapes the layers where the water has been rising and falling so let's get to work at trying to figure out what country this might be it's pretty arid it could be this could be Spain Mexico let's have a look right not sure what that is I'm trying to figure out what side of the road they're driving on but it's so far down ah you know you can see from these Road markings they're driving on the right which which actually hardly narrows it down at all I'd be surprised if it was left if it was left that would mean it's Australia wouldn't it um so Mexico don't know do not know those Road markings could they be they couldn't really be European could they with that yellow in the middle am I right and it was taken by DJ veg which really I like that because it doesn't give anything away got some boats there lots of vehicles mainly Camper vans a few boats um but yeah I think I'm ready to have a little search on the map now to be honest it's not going to be America is it I mean oh but it's every US state I'm sorry I'm sure you forgive me but I I forgot I forgot that it's every US state this could well be a us US state it is a one in three chance that we'll get a US state we've also got some pretty good some pretty impressive like infrastructure here as well right so I think we yeah I think we're looking at like Nevada New Mexico Arizona wow this could this could take a little while like me we have here I'll get it but it'll take a bit of searching I think the one thing we've got going for us the main thing is the dam on the south so that's North so it's kind of like a a y shape or a v a V shape with the dam at the bottom so let's bear that in mind as we search Hoover Dam wow Hoover Dam well hang on a minute how far does that go no I don't think we're looking at that no we're not looking at Hoover Dam California no no I'm not going to search there for now Colorado what about this one here the naaj dam don't think that's right either remember the compass could be wrong Compass could be wrong that's quite a distinctive that that arm but then it raises the question what was the water level that that could be an island on an ordinary summer's day so bear it in mind I don't think it's that Lake though where are we now Colorado yeah where's the where's the biggest one in Colorado is it that one I wonder if things can get skewed by the you know the lens of this thing I don't think we're there really this this looks like New Mexico Arizona sort of Direction that's got to be it that's got to be it you could tell it a mile off it's actually not so much of a v that is the lens thing that I'm talking about uh skewing that it's actually quite straight from that side to that side but this is definitely it you can see every little feature you can see that bit there jutting out not an island you can see that bit of Lake there which is there so interestingly that's the biggest lake in Arizona so it's not counting that one then which is clearly bigger it's obviously it's given that to Nevada I presume anyway it's the Theodore Roosevelt Lake and Dam let's just try and make sure we don't lose any more points we can always give ourselves a moral perfect score so got to just put ourselves in the middle of the screen here so about there and it's a full score on round two 8 7 yards I think many of you would have got that one if you didn't get the first one but yeah well done if you found that one that was a bit easier that Lake ",

asia here but we we almost got the full europe seed and we get 22.5 to show for it losing our country streak but guys i say we do for one more here um and uh hopefully i i beat some of you guys at that one i i'd like to think that that was a decent game especially for no kanji compass but yeah giving those country streaks is tough on this on this uh map and this mode okay so here is a good little round i like this one should be an interesting get see if we can get see if we can win a bit of a 50 50 yeah okay so here now we've got a bit more bollard guess so if you know your bars this round does become significantly easier but actually there's a number of things that i can tell you guys about this round okay so first off we've got a chevron here uh red and white red on white is the most common chevron type in europe there are so many countries especially in eastern europe that use this for example um like croatia romania turkey i believe hungary slovakia czechia um and then a lot of the kind of um ex-soviet countries in in kind of the more russian sphere of influence use a white on red as opposed to red and white um so you can distinguish them that way i'll flash up a map if not um someone remind me and i'll put it inside the description but yeah that is that's definitely worth learning these chevrons for example um there's there's also like you can also get yellow on black which is in portugal ireland uh norway and uh luxembourg i can't remember which the other one is that uses those but you know it's where it's supposed to say very useful to learn those but here we have the bollard with the two orange reflectors this is only in two countries and those are slovakia and czechia so we've already narrowed down mostly using this bollard but say we didn't have the blood we could also narrow it down to some kind of eastern european country most likely with this one here okay but now let's uh let's look at this guard rail which also had which also has like a flat edge and a wide gap between and i'm pretty sure this one if not exclusive is most commonly found in czechia and slovakia so czechoslovakia are cheeky because they they tend to use all the same things and it makes it very very difficult to uh tell the difference okay this is generation three coverage by the way uh which you would which you would see in both countries whereas generation four would only really be seen in czechia um by borrowing a few tiny examples so yeah we should be somewhere in either of the countries as we've established okay so then uh we um i guess we i guess we look a bit further around and see if there's anything else here this one is definitely hilly but not in a way that kind of tells me one or the other i guess as a rule like slovakia is more mountainous but you do get tons of hills in czechia as well i think at this point i do actually prefer slovakia but it's not it's just a vibe thing at this at this stage there's not anything that would really tell me one way or the other and i'm very prepared to say that it could easily be checkier also we've got a skoda here and scrotas are quite common in both countries made around there and also we have all white road lines obviously typical for europe if you if you didn't know that yet and blue strip on the plate so it'll it all checks out that's for sure um just trying to think of where i actually want to put this one but yeah as for me i think i think just somewhere well i might just click near the border as a bit of a hedge sometimes you've got sometimes you've just got a hedge in geoguessing i feel like that's that's kind of right now um road quality is very good here i don't really know if i could use that to swing my decision one way or the other might feel a bit more western european but you could certainly see it in either country there's no doubt about that i might actually go check you here i might um but yeah i'm still going to click near the border here just because i'm i'm pretty i'm pretty pretty hopeless when it comes to this 50 50. so let's find out shall we uh ends up being 32 kilometers away so a good switch a good switch there really nice score um ", "points": 4893,

going to play these seeds first and then i'm going to teach you guys what i know about the different matters that we're going to see in these rounds and all the different tips and tricks that you can use to up your level of gameplay i hope by watching this video you'll at least learn some things hopefully in every location i'll be able to teach you at least two or three so let's get straight into this first link which is found in the description hopefully you've played it by now and uh let's see what we got going on i've also blurred out the car so that we are not using that to decide where we're going to go because a lot of people like to learn the actual tips rather than just the car meta here is the first one this architecture strikes me as quite southeast asian off the bat also we have a whole bunch of motorbikes motorbikes are fairly common in latin america as well but certainly the part of the world where you see them the most is southeast asia particularly you could say like indonesia malaysia thailand that kind of area there okay so we see plenty of those scooters and bikes right now so let's take a look around here we've got a mix of like what appears to be arabic and also what appears to be some kind of latin script language as well here which is interesting interesting indeed oh this girl is wearing a head scarf as well so that would definitely factor into our guess later down the track okay so just looking for anything let's have a flag here so that will probably help as well at some point okay so we're fairly built up here which is interesting um again we have the flag painted on um the pulse here so this will be indonesia and indonesia is a very patriotic country so you'll often see that around the spot here okay so let's take one more look okay here's here's a very uh important thing to know for indonesia is that oftentimes they'll have cigarette ads all around the place and the price is normally around 15 000 i think it's root rupees over there so i'm pretty sure that's what they use in uh it starts with an i i think it starts with an r anyway um and and it's normally going to be about 15 000 somewhere in that ballpark 16 000 is also pretty common for the price of cigarettes so you can often use that as a pretty good way to tell indonesia because that's the only country using that um uh currency so yeah um we also have this kind of very very indo slash malay looking language here so yeah obviously that is going to be pretty nice um the question is where it kind of reminded me of borneo a little bit it also kind of reminded me of sulawesi so i'm kind of tossing up between those two seeing if there's any i've learned i know the phone codes for indonesia but i don't think we're actually going to get any or offer here so yeah uh and then polls are also quite useful but i don't think we see any as well so then actually the longer i look at it the more i kind of like just going java here um i could easily see sulawesi or any any any uh island here but i think i will just go java so let's find out where it actually is and it ends up ", "points": 1848, "distance": 1485.0, "challenge_info": {"challenge": {"token":

sure if you're an indonesian expert you could have so starting off with a low score but hopefully you learned some stuff about indonesia and uh here we are and uh this one would appear to be in a similar type of region of the world let's say okay so let's take a look at what we see on this one we see all white road lines it's going to be very significant for helping us decide where to go we also have a black and white signposts which will also help factor in for the country here um it's quite apparent that we are driving left-hand side of the road here even though this this whole like pulling over section over here this car is driving on the left-hand side of the road and you can see this sign is set up for left-hand drive this is the back of the sign the cars for their headlights facing us here we'll drive down the road and they'll be able to see this sign facing towards them okay so that's pretty useful um vegetation wise we also have a whole bunch of oil palms here oil palms very common in indonesia particularly borneo and likewise maybe even more common in malaysia um also common in southern thailand as well i'm pretty sure that's the extent of where they're very commonly found so good to keep that in mind okay and then we also have a black number plate which is divided in two here we have one set of text here one set of text here wide black number plate if this were in indonesia which it's not then we would have three sets of text as it stands we only have two and so that would that would indicate that we are in malaysia okay so yeah all white road lines as well very malaysian and oftentimes you'll have a double white line um in the center double white line but we don't have that here if you do have that and you're in asia i'm pretty sure malaysia's the only country in asia that uses double whites at least the only country that commonly does it so um yeah we should be on borneo here and the reason i say that is because we're in generation three camera which is more common in borneo and we also have all these oil palms which are also more common in borneo and it's very flat as well whereas peninsula malaysia tends to be quite hilly all the way through so i would say we're somewhere around here maybe i'm just trying to think actually how far up i want to go here maybe it could be somewhere around here it's probably going to

next round here let's check out what we've got going on uh okay so we have some language here we'll return to that at some point soon okay so we have holy poles over here that's definitely going to factor into our decision later on you'd call this one a wide holy pole um and there are three countries in europe that tend to use holy poles very often and there's a hungry romania and poland you can also find holy polls of some description in france and belgium and then also occasionally in portugal although portuguese one's a bit different and then elsewhere in eastern europe as well okay so that's kind of what we're working with here okay we are fairly hilly but not all too hilly um one also one also thing to mention about this holy pool here is that it's painted white at the bottom which will also factor into our decision later on as well okay so we have some bollards here these are in the australian style this is an australian style bowl a little bit shorter so you'd find this kind of a board in in the netherlands as well although of course we're not there because with mountains like this these would easily exceed the highest point in the netherlands okay and then uh we also have some architecture here which will come in useful architecture kind of the thing you need to get like your own feel for by playing a lot but i would definitely say that that's useful here and also the white center lines should guarantee that we're in europe as opposed to elsewhere okay so i'm coming to my decision here given the fact that a lot of the trees are painted right at the bottom as well as this wide holy pole here i think this should be in romania so let's uh take a look at this sign here to confirm that we're speaking some kind of romance language and we are we can see the de uh kind of word here that would that would definitely remind me of a romance language such as like italian or french or something like that but of course we're in eastern europe so this one will be romania this architecture here kind of reminded me more of like hungary or slovakia or serbia so i was thinking of guessing this side of the country uh who knows if that's going to be correct or not that's kind of my own thinking on the round though and uh yeah that's about it i mean these bars these are not typical for romania although you can find them there so i think that's about all we need

two rounds from this video so here we are using a concrete road this is probably the biggest clue on around like this concrete roads around the world fairly common in philippines in thailand um you can find concrete roads fairly often in like peru ecuador and colombia as well uh bolivia i believe every now and again uses some concrete roads as well i'm just trying to think of other countries where where concrete reds are fairly prevalent but yeah these ones in southeast asia are particularly where you'll see a lot of them and now in thailand you wouldn't see so many concrete roads that are indonesia i forgot to mention as well uh thailand you wouldn't see so many concrete roads that are double land uh whereas in philippines you would see them quite often so philippines immediately coming to mind here okay so we have some like banana plants here very common all over southeast asia that's for sure we also have these red and white chevrons here now i can't claim to know my chevrons of asia that well i know them pretty much all in europe but as for these chevrons you can definitely see red and white in philippines and it's quite useful i think you'll also see red and white in sri lanka um and probably some others as well although i think all the ones in all the other like proper possibilities would not be a factor with red and white i believe also clearly we're driving right hand side of the road and so that cuts out uh thailand cambodia japan malaysia indonesia i'm not cambridge sir but you know um and so yeah plenty of countries that drive left-hand side of the road okay so all that having been said we seem to be quite high up here and so the tallest mountains in malaysia i mean in philippines i would say somewhere up here so that's really what i'm thinking of guessing although it could just be a really wet day and that's why it looks so elevated and so is there anything else to say here um we also have a bit of english which is very typical to see in the philippines and uh we do probably have the location of where we are here but i can't be bothered actually pinpointing on a teaching video well all white road lines is interesting as well um

the country quite well but then i often confuse north and south with one another so unfortunate result there but we do fine okay so the next one here we are on full country streak let's see if we can continue on that theme this one we're immediately going to look at the road lines obviously i'm always harping on about road lines in this series but i really do think it's so important that you learn where we'll have yellow in the center and when we'll have white in the center and so we appear to have double yellow lines in the center here which would mean somewhere in the americas is immediately much much more likely so the only country that where you would never see like double yellow lines like this is like chile where you'd have double white lines and then some of these countries like peru ecuador colombia mexico are more likely to use a single yellow line in the center but still most you'll be able to find double yellows as well okay let's take a look at the poles next these poles are sectioned they have three sections in them they have dots towards the top and they're completely made of concrete so perhaps that rings a bell for you if it does then um then you should know the country if it doesn't then keep keep the image of this pole in your mind because it is one of the more useful polls to know in the whole geography i would say and so we have red roofs on a lot of the buildings as well this would probably indicate some european influence i think it's fair to say we also have a lot of motorbikes as i said motorbikes can be found quite often in south america this one does not really feel like southeast asia in fact the only countries you'd see double yellows in southeast asia would be like taiwan just trying to think i think maybe in some times in cambodia you'd see or maybe sometimes in thailand as well but yeah not particularly common thing to see in southeast asia okay so i am thinking with these uh concrete section poles that we should be somewhere in brazil now brazil uses these poles all around the country you can see fairly similar ones with shorter sections in them in ecuador and then brazil is a pretty good good uh a good call when you see a pole like this in south america also to mention we have these clear satellite dishes very common for roofs of brazilian houses and so the question is where and um with these hills i am kind of liking north a lot of red roofs and kind of dis-shaped hills in the north of the country um i could as easily see it being somewhere like much further out here i could also see it being you know somewhere in goyas or tokantins as well but yeah i mean um i uh i think we should be correct here and so i'm just trying to see if there's anything else that's particularly useful a lot of motorbikes and i think that may indicate that we're in a poorer area and this is kind of a poor area as opposed to the deep south which is quite more or quite a bit more wealthy in brazil um but i think that's about all i can see the double yellows in the center those concrete poles here and kind of this just general landscape and feel is quite brazilian indeed so let's see if i'm right about where it is it ends up

guess left a lot to be desired but i i think that was a good one so let's head into the second challenge link now and the hope for a another seed where we can uh just run through some of the more important things here so um yeah let's get that one click that in the description play it before you move on to this one let's see how we go okay here so first one here is immediately giving me a certain vibe so we should be in generation two camera here now generation two camera is the coverage taken about a decade and a few years ago 12 13 years ago and uh yeah yeah about that long ago almost and uh we should be in somewhere in western europe for that reason eastern europe did not get much generation two coverage there's not too much generation 2 in the united states interestingly although mexico and canada have quite a bit of it south america is largely devoid of generation 2 apart from a little bit in brazil and maybe colombia as well i think and yeah and then australia new zealand have it but this is a european start sign here and uh yeah i mean actually you may be able to see a single sign in new zealand but regardless i'm pretty sure with this climate we shouldn't be there okay and then south africa also has gen 2 as well so um yeah let's check out what we've got going on here seems like some oak trees or something like that a lot of fruit bushes as well this is the first video round of the video where i'm not entirely sure of the country although i'm pretty sure we're gonna be able to get there um i hope anyway okay so we do have a a mountain or a volcano over there which is really interesting we have another red tiled roof we also have an olive tree here or something regardless it might not be an olive tree but it's very mediterranean looking so i'd immediately start thinking about those types of countries but anyway portugal all the way through to greece here greece is another country that has a lot of generation two camera um these poles here do appear to have the color of being concrete especially this one here i would say and uh greece tends to use wooden balls so we can probably cut grease out here at least tentatively um so we're on a fairly it feels like a warm climber i would say um it definitely it definitely does not feel too cold and with this and this this uh concrete pole does feel round to me and um so i'm thinking italy and now let me let let you know of the thing that most makes me think of italy which is this kind of dark back to this sign and now dark backs to science can be found in many countries in europe but it's especially prevalent in italy albania and romania they're the three countries we can reliably have it now north macedonia i mean i've seen fairly grey looking ones in poland just today and in many other places but uh generally speaking when you have a darker back of the sun like this italy is a good shout and of the countries that we mentioned romania has extremely rare gen 2 and north pacific has no generation two so italy is the go right okay so fairly mountainous over this direction i don't have the compass enabled because that's what the uh cast group gets rid of i think it's actually k we can bring back the compass okay so like the uh kind of mountain or volcano to our south and then over to our east we also have some mountain range as well so um i'm just going to guess kind of somewhere over here but i dare say that we are going to be somewhere in like central southern ", "points": 4411, "distance": 187.0, "challenge_info": {"challenge": {"token":

road um single yellow lines okay so um quite commonly found in thailand cambodia and indonesia i would say um let's take a look at where this car was driving so this car is driving right hand side of the road so we can actually eliminate all but cambodia there okay i'm moving over to south america i already mentioned earlier in the video that you often see a single yellow line in bolivia um peru actually i'm not sure how common it is in bolivia made brew ecuador uh colombia guatemala mexico okay and i am thinking um that this truck here this pickup truck kind of looks more like one that will be made in the united states and when you see a truck like that then mexico and guatemala have got to come to mind you often see quite a lot in ecuador a lot as well in my opinion in my experience but uh um i i definitely think that when you see a truck like that mexico and what have got to come to mind for you also this might be an american car as well come to think of it um as for architecture here there's not too much going on uh it's very lush it's very green so a lot of mexico is surprisingly dry and so we can we can definitely chop off maybe the first half of mexico here and so that's probably not a possibility also the sun here is to the south so that would indicate northern hemisphere most likely i mean it's not directly to the south but it's definitely more so to the south so i would feel fairly confident using that hint here okay so because we can't see the google car generally speaking when you can see the google car you can see the the silver car with the with the rear view mirrors which um would probably be visible here if we are in guatemala which i have a feeling we might be um if not if you're not using the uh google car meta and it can be quite difficult to distinguish the two countries but essentially we've got a fairly mountainous landscape here and we are fairly tropical and we have this single yellow line as i said both countries use i would be leaning towards what here but i i could certainly see a southern mexico even something along the coasts here either side where it's a bit greener is also certainly possible we have a political poster here i feel like both countries you do see them and but i'm i'm relatively confident that it is north america here so we may lose our six country streak here it's possible but i will go for guatemala

"challenge_index": 1, "split_transcript": "guatemala just on the mexican border this is kind of the the region i expected it to be in and so we uh we end up surviving yet again and so we are sitting on a seven country stream here going quite nicely okay the next one here plenty of clues but let's let's try and break it down here for ourselves okay so first things to notice road lines always always look down for the road lines first we are using all white road lines here including a double wire in the center and that is going to be very useful indeed in fact will be one of the deciding factors in our guess here we're driving right hand side of the road so assuming that we are you know in europe which i mean the architecture looks very european indeed i think it's fair to say then uh we should not be in united kingdom ireland malta and cyprus as well although there's no uh coverage there okay so that is uh they're the places that drive left so we've got a blue strip on the plate as well so probably not russia probably not ukraine generally speaking two countries that don't use blue strips on plate um and so then we are kind of thinking about you know mainland continental standard europe here okay so let's break down some of the things that we could use to get the country here and i'll reveal to you that the country is poland okay so why is it poland we have this concrete pole here with the with the uh kind of um oval holes in it here and these ones are are the polish variants where they don't go all the way to the ground whereas in um in for example hungary and romania normally the holes would go all the way out into the ground whereas on this one they cut off before the end and before the top so that is quite a polish pole indeed um we also have double whites in the center of the road here and for whatever reason on a on many roads around europe you'll find up whites don't get me wrong but on a thinner road like this where it's kind of like it's quite suburban like why would you really have a double line here generally speaking which means no overtaking um well you have one here and and and you have those quite often on thinner roads in poland i think denmark is another country that has a very uh has a ponchon for these uh double white lions where else do i often see them um greece often has them and they're often faded in greece as well so that's three countries where you often see them where you might not expect to see them in other countries okay of course you do see them in other countries but in in zones where you might not see them in other countries okay i can also think of two other things for poland here here's a pedestrian crossing and here you don't have any straps on it in poland you won't have any straps on the pedestrian crossing signs so that's quite useful indeed as well and then looking over at this house here very typical polish house bright red roof but what's more important is the dormer here inside the roof which is kind of like an extra room in like the attic or whatever you want to say um and so that is quite a common feature in polish architecture uh what else can we say here it's quite flat as well poland is a relatively flat country at least in the in this in the interior of it and uh yeah okay and these these trees also quite fairly northern feeling as well okay so i'm not exactly sure where i'm going to go here i probably just click in the center of the country for this for around like this so uh i think that's what i'll do maybe a little bit further south let's go let's go there okay and so we should be close here ends ", "points": 4291, "distance": 228.0, "challenge_info": {"challenge": {"token": "H4BIrGZxgc311Rbt", "mapSlug": "62a44b22040f04bd36e8a914", "roundCount": 5,

a little bit but that's fine okay next one here well this one's interesting this one's interesting very red soil we have not had many soil dependent rounds just yet as we've been playing today but this one has very red soil uh and so countries where you can see red soil around the world brazil is the stereotypical red soil country and it's funny because the rest of the south american countries minus parts of uruguay and argentina in the panhandle here um do not really have too much red soil at all so brazil really confines it in its own borders obviously you can find some in kenya and uganda they're two countries that are quite known for having red soil as well australia cambodia thailand um they're all countries that have red soil as well maybe sometimes south africa has reddish soil kind of orangish soil um sometimes in the us where of as well like alabama mississippi area can have some red soil so that's where i'd say even even part of canada as well maybe um but yeah red soil like this i'm thinking of i'm thinking of uh brazil so other things that make me think of south america here are these kind of wooden fences with like a woodwood wood like that um fairly typical of brazil and obviously we are not using any script here so a lot of time people confuse cambodia for brazil but of course if you have any like latin script then uh brazil should be fairly safe to send as opposed to uh cambodia which normally uses the khmer script or whatever it's called okay so this one's a kind of a rolling landscape i've just been practicing my brazil recently but i'm still not entirely sure i kind of like talk on teens here but i could also see something like like in the really dry part of akra or rondonia maybe rondonio or mata grosso maybe so somewhere along this band here i kind of expect it to be um what i said to say dirt road coverage not too common in brazil but certainly seeable and um yeah yeah it's kind of like a brazil's kind of a country that has like hills all around the spot and then mountains along the coast so let's uh let's go for token teens here ends up being goyas so not the greatest guess ever but only one state over to be fair so 3

time it could trip you up if you're not used to seeing this country because it is relatively rare to see in geoguessa but okay so we appear to be driving left hand side of the road here you can particularly see that from this guy although um he is kind of driving more so in the center of the road so if you didn't pick that up i could certainly forgive you for that was i have a black and white curb here and for whatever reason i have no idea what the reason is but like black and white curbs painted like that seems to be much more common in second and third world countries um only first world countries i can think of where you could really see a black and white curb often would be like israel israel you see it quite a bit but yeah most most times when you see something like that you're going to be in a poorer country obviously you can see that from the uh from the kind of infrastructure here anyway but you know it's worth bearing in mind i think especially if you're playing an mpz or something like that okay so we have like a lot of pine trees here or something like that which is which is certainly interesting and the big one here is actually going to be the architecture so let's take a look at these houses we have like intricate patterns on this one it's very very cool looking house and then and these ones here i would say are the kind of typical ones very asian looking roofs here i think it's fair to say kind of flat and wide um and then you know you know and they they also have like kind of wooden panels and then also these white panels as well i think that's the that's the really uh that's really uh unique thing about this country's um houses and so i do believe we are going to be somewhere in bhutan here now i just don't think you can really see um any kind of houses that look like this outside of bhutan like it really is just the the bhutanese maybe maybe if you're in nepal or something but nepal has very limited trekker coverage whereas bhutan actually has some street view now if you see these then uh and these these types of houses lots of windows as well then it should be bhutan and obviously the landscape fits here as well now i'm not sure where this one's going to be the mountains are not the tallest so i was thinking of like some valley like that something like this it also feels a little dryer but i'm actually not too sure regardless left hand drive also uh british influence inside bhutan and uh yeah i feel i'm feeling pretty good here i'll send in this one will be ", "points": 4537, "distance": 145.0, "challenge_info":
